## Model description

There are two main components involved in this process:

- a pre-trained speaker diarization pipeline from the [`pyannote.audio`](pyannote.github.io) package (also available as a [stand-alone diarization model](https://replicate.com/meronym/speaker-diarization) without transcription):

  - `pyannote/segmentation` for permutation-invariant speaker segmentation on temporal slices
  - `speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb` for generating speaker embeddings
  - `AgglomerativeClustering` for matching embeddings across temporal slices

- OpenAI's `whisper` model for general-purpose English speech transcription (the `medium.en` model size is used for a good balance between accuracy and performance).

The audio data is first passed in to the speaker diarization pipeline, which computes a list of timestamped segments and associates each segment with a speaker. The segments are then transcribed with `whisper`.

## Input format

The pipeline uses `ffmpeg` to decode the input audio, so it supports a wide variety of input formats - including, but not limited to `mp3`, `aac`, `flac`, `ogg`, `opus`, `wav`.

The `prompt` string gets injected as (off-screen) additional context at the beginning of the first Whisper transcription window for each segment. It won't be part of the final output, but it can be used for guiding/conditioning the transcription towards a specific domain.

## Output format

The pipeline outputs a single `output.json` file with the following structure:

```json

  "segments": [
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "start": "0:00:00.497812",

So those things go away, and the positive feedback spiral of economic costs, where all of the advances are increasingly more"

    }

    "count": 2,

## Performance

The current T4 deployment has an average processing speed factor of 4x (relative to the length of the audio input) - e.g. it will take the model approx. 1 minute of computation to process 4 minutes of audio.

## Intended use

Data augmentation and segmentation for a variety of transcription and captioning tasks (e.g. interviews, podcasts, meeting recordings, etc.). Speaker recognition can be implemented by matching the speaker embeddings against a database of known speakers.

## Ethical considerations

This model may have biases based on the data it has been trained on. It is important to use the model in a responsible manner and adhere to ethical and legal standards.
